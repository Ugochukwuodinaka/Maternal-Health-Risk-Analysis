- __Age-risk correlation:__ Identify correlations between age and maternal health risks by examining the distribution of high risk levels across different age ranges.
- __Health parameter variations:__ Understand how health parameters such as SBP, DBP, body temperature, heart rate, and blood sugar vary across risk levels and age groups.
- __Age-related trends:__ Determine average values of health parameters for each age range, revealing age-related patterns in maternal health indicators.

### Dataset Overview:
The data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health cares through the IoT-based risk monitoring system. The dataset comprises of vital information crucial for a deep insight into the Maternal Health Risk levels, patterns and demography. It includes details such as Age,	SystolicBP,	DiastolicBP,	BS,	BodyTemp,	HeartRate, and	RiskLevel. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover maternal health risk levels, trends, and correlations that offer valuable insights into maternal health risk across different demographics.

This dataset is a CSV file made up of a single table named Maternal_Health_Risk_Dataset.csv and was provided by [Quantum Analytics](https://www.quantumanalyticsco.org/). You can click on this [link](Maternal%20Health%20Risk%20Data%20Set.csv) to access the raw data file. This dataset table is made up of 7 columns and 1,014 rows of data.  

Here's is a detailed information of the columns we have in this dataset to aid a better understanding of this analysis:
- __Age:__ This column represents the age of the individuals being analyzed in this analysis. Age is typically measured in years and serves as a demographic variable. In the context of maternal health risk analysis, age is an important factor as maternal health risks can vary based on the age of the mother.
- __SystolicBP (Systolic Blood Pressure):__ Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the maximum pressure exerted by the blood against the arterial walls when the heart contracts and pumps blood out during a heartbeat. It is the higher number in a blood pressure reading, typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Elevated systolic blood pressure can indicate hypertension or other cardiovascular health issues.
- __DiastolicBP (Diastolic Blood Pressure):__ Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the minimum pressure exerted by the blood against the arterial walls when the heart is at rest between beats. It is the lower number in a blood pressure reading, also measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Elevated diastolic blood pressure can also indicate hypertension or other cardiovascular health issues.
- __BS (Blood Sugar):__ Blood sugar refers to the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. It is typically measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Monitoring blood sugar levels is important for assessing metabolic health and detecting conditions such as diabetes mellitus.
- __BodyTemp (Body Temperature):__ Body temperature represents the degree of heat generated by the body, usually measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F). Normal body temperature ranges between 36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius (97.7 to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Abnormal body temperature can indicate fever or other health conditions.
- __HeartRate:__ Heart rate refers to the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm). It is an indicator of cardiovascular health and can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and activity level. Resting heart rate typically falls within a range of 60 to 100 beats per minute for adults.
- __RiskLevel:__ Risk level categorizes individuals into different risk groups based on predefined criteria related to maternal health risks. It is a qualitative variable indicating the likelihood of experiencing adverse maternal outcomes such as complications during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum. Risk levels can be determined based on various factors including medical history, demographic characteristics, and health indicators like blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

- <img src="images/Total_No_of_Women_By_Risk_Level_image.jpg" width="250">
- **The Total Number of Women By Risk Level:**
- In this analysis, there is a dominance of the Low-Risk Category. The data shows that the majority of women in the sample are classified as low risk, accounting for 40.04% of the total. This dominance suggests that a significant portion of the population is considered to have a lower likelihood of experiencing adverse maternal outcomes. These women may have favorable health indicators, such as stable blood pressure, normal blood sugar levels, and overall good health.
- Following the low-risk category, the mid-risk group comprises a substantial proportion of the sample, with 33.14% of women falling into this category. This indicates a notable presence of women who may have certain health factors or conditions that elevate their risk of experiencing maternal complications. 
- While the high-risk category represents the smallest proportion of women in the sample at 26.82%, it remains a significant concern due to the heightened likelihood of adverse maternal outcomes among this population. Women classified as high risk may have underlying health conditions, advanced maternal age, or other factors that increase their susceptibility to complications during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period.
  
- __Implications for Maternal Healthcare:__ The distribution of women across different risk categories underscores the importance of risk assessment and personalized care in maternal healthcare settings. By accurately identifying women at varying levels of risk, healthcare providers can tailor interventions, monitoring, and support to meet the specific needs of each group. This approach can help mitigate potential risks, improve maternal health outcomes, and enhance the overall quality of care provided to pregnant and postpartum women.
- __Need for Targeted Interventions:__ The disparities in risk distribution highlight the heterogeneity of maternal health risks within the population under study. Factors such as age, pre-existing health conditions, socio-economic status, and access to healthcare services may contribute to variations in risk levels among women. Targeted interventions and public health initiatives are needed to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to maternal healthcare resources and support.


- <img src="images/High_Risk_Count_By_AgeRange_image.jpg" width="300">
- **Count of Women On High Risk Level By Age Range:**
- In this analysis, Women in their thirties comprise the largest group among those classified as high risk, with 67 individuals. This age range is followed closely by women in their forties, fifties, and twenties, with 61, 49, and 46 women, respectively. Additionally, there are 39 women under the age of 20 and only 10 women in their sixties classified as high risk.
- __Correlation Between Age and Maternal Health Risks:__ The data suggests a notable correlation between age and maternal health risks. Women in their thirties and forties, commonly considered as advanced maternal age, show higher counts of individuals classified as high risk. This aligns with existing literature indicating that advanced maternal age is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse maternal outcomes.
- Conversely, women in their twenties and under the age of 20 also show a considerable number of individuals classified as high risk. This may reflect factors such as socio-economic disparities, inadequate prenatal care, and underlying health conditions prevalent in younger age groups that contribute to elevated maternal health risks.
- The lower count of women in their sixties classified as high risk could be attributed to factors such as menopause and decreased fertility rates, resulting in fewer pregnancies in this age group. However, it's essential to note that maternal health risks can still exist in older age groups due to age-related health issues and complications during pregnancy.

- __Implications for Maternal Healthcare:__ The distribution of high-risk levels across different age ranges underscores the importance of tailored and age-specific approaches to maternal healthcare. Healthcare providers should consider age as a crucial factor in assessing maternal health risks, providing prenatal care, and implementing preventive measures to mitigate potential complications.
- __Need for Comprehensive Risk Assessment:__ While age is an important determinant of maternal health risks, it's essential to recognize that other factors such as pre-existing medical conditions, socio-economic status, lifestyle factors, and access to healthcare also play significant roles.

- **High Risk Level, SBP & DBP By Age Range:**
- In this analysis, we dive deeper to gain insights into the distribution of high-risk levels, average systolic blood pressure (SBP), and average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) across different age ranges among women. Let's analyze the correlations between age and maternal health risks based on this information:
- __Distribution of High-Risk Levels:__ The data reveals a varying distribution of high-risk levels across different age groups among women. Women in their thirties have the highest number of high-risk cases, with 67 individuals identified as high risk, followed by women in their forties, fifties, twenties, under 20, and lastly, women in their sixties. This distribution suggests that certain age groups, particularly women in their thirties and forties, may be more susceptible to maternal health risks compared to other age groups.
- __Average Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP):__ There is a noticeable trend of increasing average SBP and DBP with advancing age among women. Women in their fifties exhibit the highest average SBP and DBP among the age groups, followed closely by women in their forties. Younger age groups, such as women in their twenties and under 20, demonstrate lower average SBP and DBP values compared to older age groups. The variations in average SBP and DBP levels across different age groups suggest age-related changes in cardiovascular health and potential implications for maternal health.
- __Correlation Between Age and Maternal Health Risks:__ The data indicates a potential correlation between age and maternal health risks, with older women demonstrating higher average SBP and DBP values and a higher prevalence of high-risk cases. Elevated blood pressure levels, particularly among women in their forties and fifties, may indicate increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. Younger age groups, such as women in their twenties and under 20, exhibit lower average blood pressure levels but still demonstrate a considerable number of high-risk cases, suggesting the presence of other contributing factors to maternal health risks in these age groups.


  
- <img src="images/Avg_BodyTemp_HeartRate_%26_BS_By_AgeRange_image.jpg" width="350">
- **Average Body Temperature, Heart Rate, and Blood Sugar By Age Range:**
- In this analysis, the of average body temperature, heart rate, and blood sugar by age range provides valuable insights into the variations in health parameters across different age groups.
- __Body Temperature:__ The data reveals slight variations in average body temperature across age groups. Younger age groups, such as those under 20 and in their twenties, tend to have slightly higher average body temperatures compared to older age groups. This is consistent with physiological norms, as body temperature generally decreases with age due to changes in metabolism and thermoregulation. However, the differences in average body temperature among age groups are relatively small, with all age groups falling within the normal range of body temperature (typically around 98.6°F or 37°C). This suggests that age may not be a significant determinant of variations in body temperature within the population studied.
- __Heart Rate:__ There is noticeable variability in average heart rate across different age groups. Younger individuals, particularly those in their twenties and forties, tend to have higher average heart rates compared to older age groups. This could be attributed to factors such as higher levels of physical activity, increased metabolic rate, and overall cardiovascular health. Conversely, older age groups, such as those in their fifties and sixties, exhibit slightly lower average heart rates. This could be indicative of age-related changes in heart function, decreased cardiac efficiency, and changes in autonomic nervous system regulation.
- __Blood Sugar:__ The data reveals significant variations in average blood sugar levels across different age groups. Older age groups, particularly those in their forties, fifties, and sixties, tend to have higher average blood sugar levels compared to younger age groups. This is consistent with the increased prevalence of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes mellitus with advancing age. Younger age groups, such as those under 20 and in their twenties, demonstrate lower average blood sugar levels. This could be attributed to factors such as healthier dietary habits, higher physical activity levels, and better glucose metabolism in younger individuals.
- In summary, the analysis highlights the variations in health parameters across different age groups, emphasizing the importance of age-specific health monitoring and interventions in promoting optimal health and wellness.

- **Average Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure By Age:**
- Let's explore the variations of systolic blood pressure (SystolicBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DiastolicBP) across different ages in this analysis. 
- __Systolic Blood Pressure (SystolicBP):__ Systolic blood pressure tends to increase with age, peaking around middle age before potentially decreasing in older age groups.
In the provided data, we observe a gradual increase in systolic blood pressure from ages 10 to 50, with occasional fluctuations. Notably, there is a significant increase in systolic blood pressure starting from the late twenties to forties, with values exceeding 120 mmHg in many cases. After age 50, there appears to be some variability in systolic blood pressure, with values ranging from around 110 to 140 mmHg, reflecting potential differences in health status and lifestyle factors among older individuals.
- __Diastolic Blood Pressure (DiastolicBP):__ Diastolic blood pressure also tends to increase with age, although the trend is less pronounced compared to systolic blood pressure.
In the provided data, we observe a general trend of increasing diastolic blood pressure with age, particularly from ages 10 to 50. Similar to systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure values exceed 80 mmHg starting from the late twenties to forties, indicating potential hypertension risk among these age groups. After age 50, diastolic blood pressure values remain relatively stable, with occasional fluctuations observed among older age groups.
- Overall, the data highlights age-related variations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with a general trend of increasing values observed from younger to middle-aged individuals. These findings underscore the importance of age-specific monitoring and management of blood pressure to prevent hypertension-related complications and promote cardiovascular health across the lifespan.

- In this analysis, we have information containing data on body temperature across different age groups. Let's explore the variations of body temperature across these ages:
- __Variations in Body Temperature:__ Body temperature tends to vary across different age groups, reflecting age-related physiological changes and potential health conditions.
In this data analysis, we observe fluctuations in body temperature across different age groups, with some ages showing higher or lower average temperatures compared to others.
Notably, there is a wide range of body temperature values observed, ranging from around 98°F to 102°F. Younger age groups, such as those in their teens and twenties, generally exhibit lower average body temperatures, with values ranging from around 98°F to 99°F. In contrast, some older age groups, particularly those in their forties and fifties, show slightly higher average body temperatures, with values exceeding 99°F in some cases. It's important to note that body temperature can be influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, physical activity levels, and underlying health conditions. Therefore, fluctuations in body temperature across different age groups may reflect a combination of these factors.
- Overall, the data highlights the variations in body temperature across different age groups. While fluctuations in body temperature are normal, it's essential to monitor temperature readings closely, especially in the context of health assessments and medical evaluations.


- <img src="images/Avg_HeartRate_By_Age_image.jpg" width="450">
- **Average Heart Rate By Age:**
- In this analysis, we are looking into the data on heart rate across different age groups. Let's analyze the variations of heart rate across these age groups:
- __Variations in Heart Rate:__ Heart rate, measured in beats per minute (bpm), is influenced by various factors such as age, fitness level, activity level, and overall health status.
In this analysis, we observe fluctuations in heart rate across different age groups, with some ages showing higher or lower average rates compared to others. The average heart rate ranges from approximately 66 bpm to 90 bpm across the different age groups. Younger age groups, such as those in their teens and twenties, generally exhibit lower average heart rates, typically ranging from around 66 bpm to 80 bpm. In contrast, some older age groups, particularly those in their forties, fifties, and sixties, show slightly higher average heart rates, with values exceeding 80 bpm in some cases. It's important to note that heart rate can vary widely among individuals, and factors such as fitness level, medication use, and underlying health conditions can influence heart rate readings.
- In conclusion, the data highlights the variations in heart rate across different age groups. While fluctuations in heart rate are normal and can be influenced by various factors, monitoring heart rate trends over time can provide valuable insights into cardiovascular health and overall well-being.
